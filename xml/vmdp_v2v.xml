 <title>VMDP and v2v support</title>
 <para>
  We have added support for easier installation in V2V cases, where the guest
  is migrated from one hypervisor to another (eg. From Xen to KVM). In order
  to allow for that VMDP will be also distributed as an RPM, allowing for easy
  integration with <emphasis>v2v</emphasis> tools included in SUSE Linux
  Enterprise Server 12.
