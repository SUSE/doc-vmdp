  <para>
   &productname; contains Windows* disk and network
   device drivers to enable the high-performance hosting of these unmodified
   guest operating systems on top of &sls;. Paravirtualized drivers for
   &sls; are available, but not included in this Driver Pack.
   Paravirtualized drivers for &sls; are distributed under an open source
   license. They are included in both physical and electronic media of &sls;
   and corresponding Customer Center update channels.

   <title>Introduction</title>
   <para>
    Virtualization allows the consolidation of Linux workloads on newer, more
    powerful, energy-efficient hardware. Paravirtualized operating systems such
    as &sls; are aware of the underlying virtualization platform, and can
    therefore interact efficiently with it. Unmodified operating systems are
    unaware of the virtualization platform and expect to interact directly with
    the hardware. Because this is not possible when consolidating servers, the
    hardware must be emulated for the operating system. Emulation can be slow,
    but it is especially troubling for high-throughput disk and network
    subsystems. Most performance loss occurs in this area.

   <title>Bringing Performance</title>
   <para>
    The device drivers in &productname; bring many of
    the performance advantages of paravirtualized operating systems to
    unmodified operating systems: Only the paravirtualized device driver (not
    the rest of the operating system) is aware of the virtualization platform.
    For example, a paravirtualized disk device driver appears as a normal,
    physical disk to the operating system. However, the device driver interacts
    directly with the virtualization platform (with no emulation) to
    efficiently deliver disk access, allowing the disk subsystems to operate at
    near native speeds in a virtualized environment, without requiring changes
    to existing operating systems.
