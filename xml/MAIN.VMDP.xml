   SUSEÂ® Linux Enterprise Virtual Machine Driver Pack contains disk and
   network device drivers for a number of third-party operating systems in
   order to enable the high-performance hosting of these unmodified guest
   operating systems on top of &sls; &productnumber; (&slsa; &productnumber;).

   <title>Introduction</title>
   <para>
    Virtualization allows the consolidation of Linux workloads on newer, more
    powerful, energy-efficient hardware. Paravirtualized operating systems
    such as &sls; are aware of the underlying virtualization platform, and can
    therefore interact efficiently with it. Unmodified operating systems are
    unaware of the virtualization platform and expect to interact directly
    with the hardware. Because this is not possible when consolidating
    servers, the hardware must be emulated for the operating system. Emulation
    can be slow, but it is especially troubling for high-throughput disk and
    network subsystems. Most performance loss occurs in this area.

   <title>Bringing performance</title>
   <para>
    The device drivers in &sle; Virtual Machine Driver Pack bring many of the
    performance advantages of paravirtualized operating systems to unmodified
    operating systems because only the paravirtualized device driver (not the
    rest of the operating system) is aware of the virtualization platform. For
    example, a paravirtualized disk device driver appears as a normal,
    physical disk to the operating system. However, the device driver
    interacts directly with the virtualization platform (with no emulation) to
    efficiently deliver disk access, allowing the disk and network subsystems
    to operate at near native speeds in a virtualized environment, without
    requiring changes to existing operating systems.
