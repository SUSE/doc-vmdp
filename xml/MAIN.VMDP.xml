  <para>
   &productname; contains Windows* disk and network
   device drivers to enable the high-performance hosting of these unmodified
   guest operating systems on top of &sls;. Paravirtualized drivers for
   &sls; are available, but not included in this Driver Pack.
   Paravirtualized drivers for &sls; are distributed under an open source
   license. They are included in both physical and electronic media of &sls;
   and corresponding &scc; update channels.

   <title>Introduction</title>
   <para>
    Virtualization allows the consolidation of Linux workloads on newer, more
    powerful, energy-efficient hardware. Paravirtualized operating systems such
    as &sls; are aware of the underlying virtualization platform, and can
    therefore interact efficiently with it. Unmodified operating systems are
    unaware of the virtualization platform and expect to interact directly with
    the hardware. Because this is not possible when consolidating servers, the
    hardware must be emulated for the operating system. Emulation can be slow,
    but it is especially troubling for high-throughput disk and network
    subsystems. Most performance loss occurs in this area.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-vmdp-drivers-performance">
   <title>Bringing performance</title>
   <para>
    The device drivers in &productname; bring many of
    the performance advantages of paravirtualized operating systems to
    unmodified operating systems: Only the paravirtualized device driver (not
    the rest of the operating system) is aware of the virtualization platform.
    For example, a paravirtualized disk device driver appears as a normal,
    physical disk to the operating system. However, the device driver interacts
    directly with the virtualization platform (with no emulation) to
    efficiently deliver disk access, allowing the disk subsystems to operate at
    near native speeds in a virtualized environment, without requiring changes
    to existing operating systems.

    <title>VMDP-WIN-VERSION</title>
    <para>
     VMDP-WIN-VERSION contains the Microsoft WHQL signed driver files for the
     Windows Server versions of the drivers contained in vmdp-211015.  The Windows
     Server drivers will also run in the corresponding Windows client versions.
     Windows 10 32-bit client drivers are signed by SUSE and certified by Microsoft. 
     All other 32-bit client drivers are signed by SUSE only.
    </para>
    <para>
     The 64-bit drivers signed only by SUSE can be installed only after the initial
     Windows installation. Windows must have the <emphasis>Testsigning mode</emphasis> activated for the drivers to load on reboot.

    <title>VMDP Community</title>
    <para>
     <package>VMDP-WIN-VERSION-Community</package> contains the same drivers as found in vmdp-211015.
     The Windows 10 Server versions (both 32 and 64-bit) have drivers signed by SUSE signed and certified by Microsoft.  All other 32/64 bit drivers are signed by SUSE only.

    <title>Windows Server 2008 R2</title>
    <para>
     Windows Server 2008 R2 VMs need to be updated to recognize the new WHQL signing
     format. Without the update, the WHQL signatures are treated as unknown and
     the drivers will not load.
