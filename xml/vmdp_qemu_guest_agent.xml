  <remark>aginies 2014-05-16: vmdp.qemu.guest.agent FIXME - :
  What's is exactly qemu guest agent channel? how to install it?
  how to check the service? What  kind of features provides qemu-guest agent?
  What are the limitation?

 <para>
  VMDP setup allows for the installation of the qemu guest agent service for
  Windows when invoked with the <command>/qemu-ga</command> command line parameter. The qemu
  guest agent requires the VM to be equipped with the qemu guest agent
  channel. Without the <emphasis>qemu guest agent channel</emphasis>,
  the qemu guest agent can install but will not load. Trying to load without
  the channel results in errors in the event log.
 </para>
 <para>
  The qemu guest agent is built in the <emphasis>mingw</emphasis> environment
  on a Linux system with no modifications to the guest agent source code.
  The guest agent and supporting DLLs remain under their respective GPL licenses.
 </para>
 <para>
  Currently many of the features of the guest agent supported in Linux vms have
  not yet been implemented for Windows. So usage of guest agent in
  Windows is somewhat limited at present.
