 <title>QEMU Guest Agent</title>
 <para>
  VMDP setup allows for the installation of the qemu guest agent service for
  Windows when invoked with the <command>/qemu-ga</command> command line parameter. The qemu
  guest agent requires the VM to be equipped with the qemu guest agent
  channel. Without the <emphasis>qemu guest agent channel</emphasis>,
  the qemu guest agent can install but will not load. Trying to load without
  the channel results in errors in the event log.
 </para>
 <para>
  The qemu guest agent is built in the <emphasis>mingw</emphasis> environment
  on a Linux system with no modifications to the guest agent source code.
  The guest agent and supporting DLLs remain under their respective GPL licenses.
